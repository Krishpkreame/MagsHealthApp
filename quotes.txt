SUCCESS IS NOT FINAL, FAILURE IS NOT FATAL, IT IS THE COURAGE TO CONTINUE THAT COUNTS.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
PUSH YOURSELF, BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE IS GOING TO DO IT FOR YOU.
NEVER STOP LEARNING, BECAUSE LIFE NEVER STOPS TEACHING.
It always seems impossible until it's done.
YOU DIDNT COME THIS FAR TO ONLY COME THIS FAR
Whatever you do, always give 100%. Unless you're donating blood.
